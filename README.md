👋 Hi, I'm @aran-root (Alejandro Hernández)

💻 Final-year Computer Engineering student at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM).
📍 Recently back from an Erasmus year in Finland, where I worked on AI, automation, and social network analysis.

I build systems that automate, simulate, and adapt — from stealth automation scripts and AI models to desktop applications and network analysis.

🚀 Selected Projects

🕵️ Stealth Browser AutomationPlaywright + Tor + fingerprint evasion + human simulation

🧠 Liver Segmentation with U-NetDeep learning on CT scans (PyTorch)

📊 Academic Network AnalysisGraph cleaning, centrality metrics, and Gephi visualizations

🏋️ GymApp (JavaFX)Personalized workout manager with PDF export

(More coming soon: C projects, low-level systems, and network simulations)

🧠 Skills & Technologies

Java · Python · JavaFX · PyTorch · Playwright · Tor · Gephi · GitC · Assembly · Operating Systems · Computer Networks

🎯 My Goal Here

To showcase real, original projects — not just school exercises — that reflect how I think, build, and learn. Always improving, always exploring.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out.

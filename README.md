💻 Computer Engineering student | 🧠 AI · 🕵️‍♂️ Cybersecurity · 🤖 Automation

Hi! I'm Alejandro (aka @aran-root). I build stealth automation systems, deep learning tools, and Java-based desktop apps. I love projects that mix creativity with technical depth—whether it's simulating human behavior in a browser, segmenting medical images, or analyzing real-world networks.

Currently finishing my Erasmus in Finland, working on applied AI, automation, and cybersecurity. I publish selected projects here with clean code and clear documentation. Let's build smart things.

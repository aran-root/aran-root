- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aran-root
  
I'm currently studying in Finland as part of an Erasmus program at the University of Eastern Finland. Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, and I canâ€™t wait to learn more about these topics and find my path in the professional world. I hope you find my projects and research interesting!
